Modified WhatsApp clients like GB or Aero WhatsApp turn out well and have very advanced features.<br>
Updating these apps is a tedious task as we have to download them from third-party websites that contain annoying ads.

So after a few months, this crazy idea came to my mind "why don't I make an Update Manager for WhatsApp, which will download, update these modified WhatsApp clients, have an easy and understandable UI, and be less than 10MB?" and that's how WhatsApp Update Manager was born.

After a few months of development, I am finally ready to introduce WhatsApp Update Manager to the masses. It has various settings for customization and an easy-to-use interface for a better user experience.
